# time card helper
a simple single page app written in python, HTML and JS that calculates the earliest time you can clock-out based on your clock-in time. 

## rules
* works on an 8hr 30mins workday 
* timecard has "bands", i.e. if you clock-in from 06:53 to 07:07 you clocked in within the 07:00 band, but if you clock-in between 07:08 and 07:22, you clocked in within the 07:25 band (etc)
